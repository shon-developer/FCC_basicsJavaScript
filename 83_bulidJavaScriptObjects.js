//* Build JavaScript Objects

//? Make an object that represents a dog called myDog which contains the properties name (a string), legs, tails and friends. You can set these object properties to whatever values you want, as long as name is a string, legs and tails are numbers, and friends is an array.

const myDog = {
  // Only change code below this line
  name: "Bruce",
  legs: 4,
  tails: 1,
  friends: ["Duke", "Henson"],

  // Only change code above this line
};
