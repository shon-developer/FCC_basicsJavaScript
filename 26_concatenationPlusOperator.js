//* Quoting Strings with Single Quotes

//? Change the provided string to a string with single quotes at the beginning and end and no escape characters. Right now, the <a> tag in the string uses double quotes everywhere. You will need to change the outer quotes to single quotes so you can remove the escape characters.

const myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';
